# Walk-through

My professional website is a two-page website consisting of an about me page and a resume page. 

The about me page includes a short summary about me and the languages and technologies I feel comfortable working with. The links at the bottom of the about me page lets users get to all my other web-pages including my Github, my Twitter ,or my blog. I am assuming since the person went to my website they would at least read the about me section. 

Once they read the about me section, the person will either click on one of my links or continue to my resume page. If they check out any of the links they will end up at my blog as I have it linked on the pages linked. If the user ends up at my resume page, they can read the extended resume I have on the website or download a shortened PDF version of my resume.

## What I wanted to do if I had more time

My current website is nice and simple but it is currently only text. I would like to have added pictures of myself or of some of my projects. Another thing I could have done was included some blog posts from my other website over at [edwin.computer](https://edwin.computer). These blog posts are on small projects I am currently working on or have worked on.
