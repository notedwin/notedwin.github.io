      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome! I am Edwin Zamudio.
        I am currently an undergraduate studying computer science at Illinois Tech. <br>
        I am actively seeking an internship where I further expand my skill set as a software engineer. <br>
        Hobbies I enjoy include biking, playing soccer, tinkering with electronics and cooking different things.
        Check out my github to see what I am currently working on.

          <h3> Grocery Store web application</h3>
          <i>November 2019 - December 2019</i>
          <p>
            This application was made for my CS425: Database Organization class. I collaborated in a group of 3 to<br>
            design and develop a Django application for an online grocery store in 2 months.
            I lead development of the application implementing user authentication, stock management and payment
            authorization while <br>committing a couple hundred lines of code.
            <br>
            Technologies used: Django and Stripe API
          </p>

          <h3> Restaurant Application</h3>
          <i>Oct 2020 to Present</i>
          <p> This project is a work in progress for my Software Engineering class. I will be working with a partner to
            create, document and develop an application in a professional manner. </p>
          <p> This project will not only include code but it will include project deliverables such as Requirement
            document, test document, etc.</p>
          <p> Technologies used: Django and Stripe</p>

          <h3> Coursework C projects </h3>
          <p> This is a collection of small projects for systems programming and computer organization.</p>
          <p> Some of the things I implemented include malloc, simple shell, terminal programs like grep, HexToMIPs.

          <h2>Personal Projects</h2>

          <h3> Python Snippets</h3>
          <i>Feb 2020 to Present</i>
          <p>
            This a collection of solutions to problems I solved from websites like LeetCode, Project Euler. Other
            solutions are interview assessments or tinkering with different API's such as Google OAuth, Spotify API and
            testing different packages.
          </p>


          <h3> Home Server</h3>
          <i>February 2018 to Present</i>
          <p>
            Local personal server consists of a raspberry pi 3 running a bunch of applications like OpenVPN, Pi-Hole, Jenkins, Nginx. 
            I have automated the deployment of my blog using Jenkins and Nginx. I host my blog on here and am looking to host all my application I have made. The main issue is safety as I am not interested in maintaining old projects to host them online. 
          </p>

          <h3> Blog </h3>
          <i>March 2020 to Present</i>
          <p> 
            I am always working on something new so instead of keeping all the things I learn to myself I would rather
            share them with people who would find my work interesting.
