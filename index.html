      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Howdy! I am Edwin Zamudio.
        I am currently an undergraduate studying computer science at Illinois Tech. I am actively seeking an internship where I further expand my skills set as a software engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy writing programs to solve issues i run into daily and writing about what I am currently working on and learning on my blog.

        Outside of school and programming, I enjoy biking, playing soccer and learning to cook and bake things.
      </p>
